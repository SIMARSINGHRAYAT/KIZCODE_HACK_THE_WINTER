## Problem Statement
Adversarial merchants are actively evading recurring payment detection by continuously shifting their behavioral patterns, which causes conventional static rule systems to fail. In real payment environments, merchant tactics evolve rapidly, and these frequent pattern shifts break rule-based filters that depend on stable heuristics. Additionally, behavioral clustering becomes unstable due to user drift, where customer payment behavior changes over time and disrupts previously learned groupings. Another major challenge is that recurring transaction streams often contain a low signal-to-noise ratio, meaning malicious indicators are subtle and buried within legitimate recurring payments. As a result, detection is delayed and systems suffer from higher false negatives, allowing suspicious or hidden-charge behavior to persist longer before being flagged.

**Key challenges highlighted:**
- Adversarial merchants bypass recurring payment detection
- Patterns shift frequently, breaking static rules
- Behavioral clustering becomes unstable due to user drift
- Recurring data has low signal-to-noise
- Outcomes include delayed detection and higher false negatives

---

## Core Objective
Recurring payments are rising rapidly, and attacks on subscription and autopay systems are becoming more stealthy and adaptive. Merchant patterns are increasingly designed to evade static detection, and user behavior drift causes clusters to break and become unreliable as a long-term detection strategy. Because of this, the system must not only detect suspicious recurring behaviors but also remain robust against changing conditions in both merchant tactics and user spending behavior. Therefore, the core objective of this project is to develop an adaptive and explainable firewall capable of detecting recurring payment abuse and hidden-charge activity with improved reliability in evolving environments.

**Objectives of the proposed solution:**
- Support rising recurring payments and modern threat trends
- Detect stealthy and adaptive attacks
- Prevent merchant evasion against static detection
- Handle user behavior drift and cluster instability
- Provide an adaptive and explainable detection firewall

## Literature Review
A literature review was conducted to support evaluation design and model benchmarking using widely adopted machine learning evaluation metrics, imbalance learning strategies, and diagnostic plotting approaches. The referenced works provide foundations for ROC analysis, precision-recall curves under imbalanced data, synthetic over-sampling (SMOTE), balanced accuracy, and correlation-based evaluation metrics.

## Proposed Methodology (Phase-I)
Phase-I introduces the initial conceptual architecture for the Hybrid-RAG approach. The proposed design frames the problem as a recurring payment abuse detection task that requires both adaptive detection logic and explainability. The system architecture is represented as a Hybrid-RAG framework intended for malicious and hidden script assessment, capturing the need for a structured pipeline that can evolve with merchant strategies and user behavior changes.

### Figure A — Proposed Hybrid-RAG Architecture (Phase-I)

**Figure A (Detailed Description):**  
This figure represents the Phase-I conceptual architecture of the proposed Hybrid-RAG (Retrieval Augmented Framework Architecture for Malicious and Hidden Script Assessment). It establishes the foundation of the solution, positioning RAG as a key layer for enhanced reasoning and explainability while acknowledging the real-world conditions where static rules fail. The figure reflects the need to build a system that can detect suspicious recurring payment behavior patterns while remaining interpretable and adaptable under adversarial dynamics.

---

## Proposed Methodology (Phase-II)
Phase-II refines and expands the architectural view of the Hybrid-RAG framework. The focus remains on detecting malicious or hidden charge patterns, but the architecture becomes more aligned toward operational integration and structured detection components. The Phase-II representation communicates how the proposed system moves beyond a conceptual approach into a more detailed and modular structure that supports hybrid decision logic.

It strengthens the system-level organization and indicates how the framework is structured to operate under shifting merchant patterns and user drift. The Phase-II methodology emphasizes improved alignment between detection stages and explainability, showing the evolution from Phase-I into a more implementation-ready architecture.

---

## Proposed Methodology (Phase-III) — End-to-End Execution
Phase-III defines the complete end-to-end operational workflow for the proposed Hybrid-RAG detection pipeline. This phase represents how recurring subscription and autopay transaction data is ingested, processed, analyzed, and evaluated. Phase-III ensures the system can detect suspicious and hidden-charge activity through a hybrid approach that combines similarity-based signals, monitoring signals, machine learning classification, and retrieval augmentation for reasoning. It also includes the evaluation loop needed to validate performance targets and iteratively tune the pipeline if outcomes are not satisfactory.

### Phase-III Steps (Pipeline Definition)
The Phase-III methodology follows these exact steps:

- **Step 1: Collect recurring autopay transaction data**
  - Includes merchant name conflicts, which is a known practical challenge in real-world recurring payment streams.

- **Step 2: Preprocess and label data**
  - Data is labeled into:
    - **Legit**
    - **Suspicious / Hidden-charge**

- **Step 3: Run the proposed hybrid pipeline**
  - The hybrid pipeline includes:
    - **Similarity**
    - **FMR**
    - **ML**
    - **RAG**

- **Step 4: Compute key performance metrics**
  - Metrics computed include:
    - **F1 Score**
    - **FPR / FNR**
    - **Latency**
    - **Throughput**

- **Step 5: Validate targets**
  - If targets are not met:
    - tune the pipeline parameters
    - repeat evaluation until the system stabilizes

## Phase-III Workflow Flowchart
To present the Phase-III pipeline in a clear operational sequence, the following flowchart depicts the complete execution structure from input data to evaluation and tuning.

### Figure 1 — Phase-III Flowchart (Execution Pipeline)
![Figure 1: Phase-III Execution Pipeline Flowchart](phase3_images/Flowchart.png)

**Figure 1 (Detailed Description):**  
This flowchart illustrates the Phase-III end-to-end workflow for recurring payment abuse detection. It reflects the full operational structure: collecting recurring autopay transactions (including merchant conflicts), preprocessing and labeling transactions into legit versus suspicious/hidden-charge classes, executing the hybrid pipeline (Similarity + FMR + ML + RAG), and then computing key metrics such as F1 score, FPR/FNR, latency, and throughput. The final part of the flowchart highlights the validation loop where performance targets are checked, and the pipeline is tuned and re-evaluated if the detection objectives are not achieved.

## Mathematical Abbreviation
This section contains the mathematical abbreviations and metric terminology used throughout the evaluation and discussion of the proposed system. These abbreviations support analysis of classification outcomes and operational performance under real transaction conditions.

---

## Merchant Behaviour Scoring
Merchant behaviour scoring is a core analytical component used to quantify and rank merchant transaction behavior patterns. This scoring helps differentiate stable recurring subscriptions from suspicious or hidden-charge behaviors by capturing signals that indicate abnormal recurrence patterns, merchant inconsistencies, and changes in transaction characteristics across time. The scoring approach is aligned with the project’s objective of developing an adaptive detection firewall that can operate under frequent drift and adversarial modifications.

---

## RAG Based RFMV Equation
The system incorporates an RAG-based RFMV equation approach to combine structured features with retrieval-augmented reasoning. This component supports improved context awareness for recurring payment behaviors by incorporating monitoring-style feature dynamics and applying retrieval augmentation to strengthen confidence and interpretability. The RFMV representation is intended to enhance detection robustness in cases where static detection rules fail and where transaction behavior patterns are subtle or masked.
